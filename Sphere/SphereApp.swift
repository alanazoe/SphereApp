In time, he would be credited with discovering nearly a fifth of the fish known to humans in his day. But the more of the hidden blueprint of life he uncovered, the harder the universe seemed to try to thwart him. His specimen collections were demolished by lightning, by fire, and eventually by the 1906 San Francisco earthquake—which sent more than a thousand discoveries, housed in fragile glass jars, plummeting to the floor. In an instant, his life’s work was shattered. \n\n Many might have given up, given in to despair. But Jordan? He surveyed the wreckage at his feet, found the first fish that he recognized, and confidently began to rebuild his collection. And this time, he introduced one clever innovation that he believed would at last protect his work against the chaos of the world. \n\n When NPR reporter Lulu Miller first heard this anecdote in passing, she took Jordan for a fool—a cautionary tale in hubris, or denial. But as her own life slowly unraveled, she began to wonder about him. Perhaps instead he was a model for how to go on when all seemed lost. What she would unearth about his life would transform her understanding of history, morality, and the world beneath her feet. \n\n Part biography, part memoir, part scientific adventure, Why Fish Don’t Exist is a wondrous fable about how to persevere in a world where chaos will always prevail.", cover: "b43")

When Kit’s best friend gets dumped by his boyfriend, he begs her to ditch her family responsibilities for an idyllic weekend in the Montana mountains. They’ll soak in hot springs, then sneak a vape into a dive bar and drink too much, like old times. Instead, their getaway only reminds Kit of everything she’s lost lately: her wildness, her independence, and—most heartbreaking of all—her sister, Julie, who died a few years ago. \n\nWhen she returns home to the Dallas suburbs, Kit tries to settle in to her routine—long afternoons spent caring for her irrepressible daughter, going on therapist-advised dates with her concerned husband, and reluctantly taking her mother’s phone calls. But in the secret recesses of Kit’s mind, she’s reminiscing about the band she used to be in—and how they’d go out to the desert after shows and drop acid. She’s imagining an impossible threesome with her kid’s pretty gymnastics teacher and the cool playground mom. Keyed into everything that might distract from her surfacing pain, Kit spirals. As her already thin boundaries between reality and fantasy blur, she begins to wonder: Is Julie really gone? \n\nNeon bright in its insight, both devastating and laugh-out-loud funny, We Were the Universe is an ambitious, inventive novel from a revelatory new voice in American fiction—a fearless exploration of sisterhood, motherhood, friendship, marriage, psychedelics, and the many strange, transcendent shapes love can take.", readers: 1023, cover: "b39", genre: .romance, rating: 4, year: "", length: "", discussion: Discussion(id: UUID(), posts: [Note(id: UUID(), user: u1, title: "Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit Amet", likes: 40, comments: [], timestamp: Date(), book: Book(), elements: [NoteElement(isText: true, text: "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.

                Area X has been cut off from the rest of the world for decades. Nature has reclaimed the last vestiges of human civilization. The first expedition returned with reports of a pristine, Edenic landscape; the second expedition ended in mass suicide, the third in a hail of gunfire as its members turned on one another. The members of the eleventh expedition returned as shadows of their former selves, and within weeks, all had died of cancer. In Annihilation, the first volume of Jeff VanderMeer's Southern Reach Trilogy, we join the twelfth expedition.

                The group is made up of four women: an anthropologist; a surveyor; a psychologist, the de facto leader; and our narrator, a biologist. Their mission is to map the terrain, record all observations of their surroundings and of one another, and, above all, avoid being contaminated by Area X itself.

                They arrive expecting the unexpected, and Area X delivers—but it’s the surprises that came across the border with them and the secrets the expedition members are keeping from one another that change everything.

After reading this book, I finally understand the appeal of the unreliable narrator. \n\n Up till now, for more than a decade, I did not understand. In fact, I've been so befuddled by it all, I've had to engage in deceit in order not to broadcast my lack of understanding. Because you see, during all this time, whenever anyone professed their love for domestic thrillers and the ubiquitous unreliable narrator, I've smiled and nodded along as if I also love those things. But in actuality, I had no idea what they were going on about. \n\n The unreliable narrators I've come across thus far had me under the mistaken impression that they must be of a very specific mold—always female, imbibing to the point of incoherence, acting unfathomably loony and paranoid, and going on and on about how no one believes them. In other words, a most unpleasant character there to frustrate the heck out of the reader and cause maximum eye-rolling and hair-tearing. You can see how I did not understand why anyone would love that. \n\n So to read Gone Girl feels like both a Eureka moment and a recognition—oh there you are, you compelling unreliable narrator, I've finally found you! \n\n What made this story work for me when so many others have failed? Well, the unreliable narrators here are smart, cunning, and sober, in other words the complete opposite of what I'm used to. No dumb, drunk, paranoid lush here, thank you very much. \n\n But it's more than that. The way the story unfolds is pretty brilliant too. You think you know what's going on, then the rug is pulled out from under you and everything you thought you knew changes. Both of the two main characters are unlikable but undeniably fascinating, and you want to keep turning the pages to see what they'd do next.\n\n And the writing is so sharp and precise, there to match perfectly to each situation and every version of the characters. There are so many insightful observations thrown in, about our culture and its ups and downs, about people and their hopes and dreams, and most of all, about marriage. At its heart, what made this story so disturbing is that there is a lot of truth written into this dark tale beneath all the exaggerations. \n\n Was this the perfect book? No, at least not for me. I did find the beginning rather slow and (what turned out to be justifiably) pretentious, the characters and the plot a tad over the top, and the ending somewhat lackluster after all that buildup. But honestly, that's just because domestic thrillers are never going to be my favorite thing. \n\n Still, it was a lot of fun to read the book that kicked off the craze. With how popular this book is and how much it influenced all that came after, it just wasn't possible to go into this completely blind. I went in already knowing about unreliable narrators and also having an inkling of what to expect. (Many years ago, I made the regrettable decision to read the synopsis of the movie in a moment of weakness.) And yet, even with all that, this still managed to surprise and entertain me. \n\nAnd most importantly, now I finally understand what everyone's talking about.")])

Along the way, Leah and Bernie discover what it means to to pursue their own ideas and dreams, and to embrace what they are capable of both romantically and artistically. \n\nHousemates is a warm and insightful coming-of-age story of youth and freedom, a glorious celebration of queer life, and how art and love might save us all.", cover: "b57", genre: .romance)

It's perfect timing for Leah, because they are a writer and have just received a grant, but they have also been feeling uninspired and want a collaborator. They love Bernie's photography and it seems like the perfect project. \n\n Everything in this book from the physical descriptions to the character development is written with an almost brutal honesty. The people are all flawed, and some- like the photography mentor- have quite big flaws. But no judgment is given by the author, she leaves everything up to the reader. \n\n I loved just how ARTSY this was.

In Zero to One, legendary entrepreneur and investor Peter Thiel shows how we can find singular ways to create those new things.\n\nThiel begins with the contrarian premise that we live in an age of technological stagnation, even if we’re too distracted by shiny mobile devices to notice. Information technology has improved rapidly, but there is no reason why progress should be limited to computers or Silicon Valley. Progress can be achieved in any industry or area of business. It comes from the most important skill that every leader must master: learning to think for yourself.\n\nDoing what someone else already knows how to do takes the world from 1 to n, adding more of something familiar. But when you do something new, you go from 0 to 1. The next Bill Gates will not build an operating system. The next Larry Page or Sergey Brin won’t make a search engine. Tomorrow’s champions will not win by competing ruthlessly in today’s marketplace. They will escape competition altogether, because their businesses will be unique.\n\nZero to One presents at once an optimistic view of the future of progress in America and a new way of thinking about innovation: it starts by learning to ask the questions that lead you to find value in unexpected places.", cover: "b117")

James Clear, one of the world's leading experts on habit formation, reveals practical strategies that will teach you exactly how to form good habits, break bad ones, and master the tiny behaviors that lead to remarkable results.\n\nIf you're having trouble changing your habits, the problem isn't you. The problem is your system. Bad habits repeat themselves again and again not because you don't want to change, but because you have the wrong system for change. You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems. Here, you'll get a proven system that can take you to new heights.\n\nClear is known for his ability to distill complex topics into simple behaviors that can be easily applied to daily life and work. Here, he draws on the most proven ideas from biology, psychology, and neuroscience to create an easy-to-understand guide for making good habits inevitable and bad habits impossible. Along the way, readers will be inspired and entertained with true stories from Olympic gold medalists, award-winning artists, business leaders, life-saving physicians, and star comedians who have used the science of small habits to master their craft and vault to the top of their field.", cover: "b118")
            var hundredStartup = Book(title: "The $100 Startup", author: Author(name: "Peter Thiel"), synopsis: "Still in his early thirties, Chris Guillebeau completed a tour of every country on earth and yet he’s never held a “real job” or earned a regular paycheck. Rather, he has a special genius for turning ideas into income, and he uses what he earns both to support his life of adventure and to give back.\n\nChris identified 1,500 individuals who have built businesses earning $50,000 or more from a modest investment (in many cases, $100 or less), and focused on the 50 most intriguing case studies. In nearly all cases, people with no special skills discovered aspects of their personal passions that could be monetized, and were able to restructure their lives in ways that gave them greater freedom and fulfillment.\n\nHere, finally, distilled into one easy-to-use guide, are the most valuable lessons from those who’ve learned how to turn what they do into a gateway to self-fulfillment. It’s all about finding the intersection between your “expertise”—even if you don’t consider it such—and what other people will pay for.  You don’t need an MBA, a business plan or even employees. All you need is a product or service that springs from what you love to do anyway, people willing to pay, and a way to get paid.\n\nNot content to talk in generalities, Chris tells you exactly how many dollars his group of unexpected entrepreneurs required to get their projects up and running; what these individuals did in the first weeks and months to generate significant cash; some of the key mistakes they made along the way, and the crucial insights that made the business stick. Among Chris’s key principles: If you’re good at one thing, you’re probably good at something else; never teach a man to fish—sell him the fish instead; and in the battle between planning and action, action wins.\n\nIn ancient times, people who were dissatisfied with their lives dreamed of finding magic lamps, buried treasure, or streets paved with gold. Today, we know that it’s up to us to change our lives. And the best part is, if we change our own life, we can help others change theirs.

This is the path I took to finding my purpose but also my voice in a world that didn’t always see me./n/nAs I wrote Finding Me, my eyes were open to the truth of how our stories are often not given close examination. We are forced to reinvent them to fit into a crazy, competitive, judgmental world. So I wrote this for anyone running through life untethered, desperate and clawing their way through murky memories, trying to get to some form of self-love. For anyone who needs reminding that a life worth living can only be born from radical honesty and the courage to shed facades and be . . . you./n/nFinding Me is a deep reflection, a promise, and a love letter of sorts to self.

As First Lady of the United States of America—the first African American to serve in that role—she helped create the most welcoming and inclusive White House in history, while also establishing herself as a powerful advocate for women and girls in the U.S. and around the world, dramatically changing the ways that families pursue healthier and more active lives, and standing with her husband as he led America through some of its most harrowing moments. Along the way, she showed us a few dance moves, crushed Carpool Karaoke, and raised two down-to-earth daughters under an unforgiving media glare.\n\nIn her memoir, a work of deep reflection and mesmerizing storytelling, Michelle Obama invites readers into her world, chronicling the experiences that have shaped her—from her childhood on the South Side of Chicago to her years as an executive balancing the demands of motherhood and work, to her time spent at the world's most famous address. With unerring honesty and lively wit, she describes her triumphs and her disappointments, both public and private, telling her full story as she has lived it—in her own words and on her own terms. Warm, wise, and revelatory, Becoming is the deeply personal reckoning of a woman of soul and substance who has steadily defied expectations—and whose story inspires us to do the same.", cover: "b130")

Notes about successes and failures, joys and sorrows, things that made me marvel, and things that made me laugh out loud. How to be fair. How to have less stress. How to have fun. How to hurt people less. How to get hurt less. How to be a good man. How to have meaning in life. How to be more me./n/nRecently, I worked up the courage to sit down with those diaries. I found stories I experienced, lessons I learned and forgot, poems, prayers, prescriptions, beliefs about what matters, some great photographs, and a whole bunch of bumper stickers. I found a reliable theme, an approach to living that gave me more satisfaction, at the time, and still: If you know how, and when, to deal with life’s challenges—how to get relative with the inevitable—you can enjoy a state of success I call “catching greenlights.”\n\nSo I took a one-way ticket to the desert and wrote this book: an album, a record, a story of my life so far. This is fifty years of my sights and seens, felts and figured-outs, cools and shamefuls. Graces, truths, and beauties of brutality. Getting away withs, getting caughts, and getting wets while trying to dance between the raindrops.\n\nHopefully, it’s medicine that tastes good, a couple of aspirin instead of the infirmary, a spaceship to Mars without needing your pilot’s license, going to church without having to be born again, and laughing through the tears.\n\nIt’s a love letter. To life.\n\nIt’s also a guide to catching more greenlights—and to realizing that the yellows and reds eventually turn green too.\n\nGood luck.", cover: "b121")

And what’s now become a movement all started with The Gifts of Imperfection, which has sold more than two million copies in thirty-five different languages across the globe.\n\nWhat transforms this book from words on a page to effective daily practices are the ten guideposts to wholehearted living. The guideposts not only help us understand the practices that will allow us to change our lives and families, they also walk us through the unattainable and sabotaging expectations that get in the way.\n\nBrené writes, “This book is an invitation to join a wholehearted revolution. A small, quiet, grassroots movement that starts with each of us saying, ‘My story matters because I matter.’ Revolution might sound a little dramatic, but in this world, choosing authenticity and worthiness is an absolute act of resistance.”", cover: "b122")

            var handmaids = Book(title: "The Handmade's Tale", author: Author(name: "Margaret Atwood"), synopsis: "The Handmaid’s Tale is a novel of such power that the reader will be unable to forget its images and its forecast. Set in the near future, it describes life in what was once the United States and is now called the Republic of Gilead, a monotheocracy that has reacted to social unrest and a sharply declining birthrate by reverting to, and going beyond, the repressive intolerance of the original Puritans. The regime takes the Book of Genesis absolutely at its word, with bizarre consequences for the women and men in its population./n/nThe story is told through the eyes of Offred, one of the unfortunate Handmaids under the new social order. In condensed but eloquent prose, by turns cool-eyed, tender, despairing, passionate, and wry, she reveals to us the dark corners behind the establishment’s calm facade, as certain tendencies now in existence are carried to their logical conclusions. The Handmaid’s Tale is funny, unexpected, horrifying, and altogether convincing. It is at once scathing satire, dire warning, and a tour de force. It is Margaret Atwood at her best.", cover: "b126")

Sylvia Plath masterfully draws the reader into Esther’s breakdown with such intensity that Esther’s neurosis becomes completely understandable and even rational, as probable and accessible an experience as going to the movies. Such thorough exploration of the dark and harrowing corners of the psyche - and the profound collective loneliness that modern society has yet to find a solution for - is an extraordinary accomplishment, and has made The Bell Jar a haunting American classic.", cover: "b127")

Thus the stage is set for one of the most telling satiric fables ever penned—a razor-edged fairy tale for grown-ups that records the evolution from revolution against tyranny to a totalitarianism just as terrible./n/nWhen Animal Farm was first published, Stalinist Russia was seen as its target. Today it is devastatingly clear that wherever and whenever freedom is attacked, under whatever banner, the cutting clarity and savage comedy of George Orwell’s masterpiece have a meaning and message still ferociously fresh.", cover: "b128")

His lifelong love of the game leads Abdurraqib into a lyrical, historical, and emotionally rich exploration of what it means to make it, who we think deserves success, the tension between excellence and expectation, and the very notion of role models, all of which he expertly weaves together with intimate, personal storytelling. “Here is where I would like to tell you about the form on my father’s jump shot,” Abdurraqib writes. “The truth, though, is that I saw my father shoot a basketball only one time.”\n\nThere’s Always This Year is a triumph, brimming with joy, pain, solidarity, comfort, outrage, and hope.

Structured like a basketball game with countdowns breaking down the sections into smaller sections that drive the story forward, Abdurraqib moves around in time & space to unpack his thoughts on miracles, underdogs, kingdoms, witnessing, and more.\n\nI loved a book about basketball.

In his latest effort, he writes about absolutely everything and masks it as an essay collection about basketball. Apparently, this is caused by the author's inital impulse to write about LeBron James, who, like him, hails from Ohio - and this great man really is a recurring theme here: He serves as a starting point to ponder home and heritage, what ambition means and what it costs for the individual and the community, how it inspires and can be a burden, how aging changes roles and perspectives, and how legacy and mythology relate.\n\nThe whole thing is losely structured like a basketball game, four quarters, intermissions and all. Part essay, part memoir, part cultural observation, part commentary, it's a very challenging read, as Abdurraqib keeps readers constantly on their toes, connecting thoughts, taking turns, digressing, changing directions. In an interview, the author explained that to him, this is a book about grace, for others and for onself, and this deep empathy and compassion shines through the stellar, lyrical sentences.\n\nShow me another contemporary cultural critic who pulls something like this off.

There is a lot going on and mostly it works but sometimes you have to trust Hanif and go with it. And while I do love basketball you do not have to watch/know/like basketball to like this book.", likes: 84),

It’s “a triumph, brimming with joy, pain, solidarity, comfort, outrage, and hope. No matter the subject of his keen focus—whether it’s basketball, or music, or performance—Hanif Abdurraqib’s exquisite writing is always poetry, always profound, and always a clarion call to radically reimagine how we think about our culture, our country, and ourselves.”⁣\n\nI do not have the words to describe how much I loved this book — The connection to basketball and in particular, the Lebron James era Cavs, is what of course drew me in, and while it did not disappoint from a basketball standpoint, it’s also about so much more — Columbus, culture, family, and grief are among its many topics.\n\nI listened to part of this on audio and Abdurraqib is a great narrator, though I found myself constantly drawn back to the physical book, wanting to read his brilliant words in print even", likes: 42)

But here’s the kicker: there are no men, no context for what happened, and no answers—ever.\n\nIt’s not a fast-paced dystopian thriller, but that’s what I loved about it. It’s quiet, eerie, and deeply philosophical. It reminded me of *The Road* by Cormac McCarthy but with an even sharper focus on isolation. Has anyone else read it?

Once the women escape their cage, they’re free in the most terrifying way possible—completely untethered from everything, including purpose. It reminded me of Sartre’s idea that freedom is both a gift and a burden.\n\nThis book isn’t for everyone, but if you enjoy stories that make you question existence itself, it’s a must-read.

Shifting through memory, and in concert with the themes of his novel On Earth We’re Briefly Gorgeous, Vuong contends with the meaning of family and the cost of being the product of an American war in America. At once vivid, brave, and propulsive, these poems circle fragmented lives to find both restoration as well as the epicenter of the break.\n\nThe author of the critically acclaimed poetry collection Night Sky with Exit Wounds, winner of the 2016 Whiting Award, the 2017 T. S. Eliot Prize, and a 2019 MacArthur fellowship, Vuong writes directly to our humanity without losing sight of the current moment. These poems represent a more innovative and daring experimentation with language and form, illuminating how the themes we perennially live in and question are truly inexhaustible. Bold and prescient, and a testament to tenderness in the face of violence, Time Is a Mother is a return and a forging forth all at once.", readers: 1023, cover: "b110", genre: .essays, rating: 4.7, year: "", length: "", discussion: Discussion(id: UUID(), posts: []), reviews: [:], price: 7.99),

They arrive at the Trans-Allegheny Lunatic Asylum in West Virginia, delivered to the hospital’s entrance by a war veteran who has forced himself into their world. There, far from family, a beloved neighbor, and the mountain home they knew, they try to reclaim their lives.\n\nThe omnipresent vagaries of war and race rise to the surface as we learn their story: their flight to the highest mountain ridges of western Virginia; the disappearance of ConaLee’s father, who left for the War and never returned. Meanwhile, in the asylum, they begin to find a new path. ConaLee pretends to be her mother’s maid; Eliza responds slowly to treatment. They get swept up in the life of the facility—the mysterious man they call the Night Watch; the orphan child called Weed; the fearsome woman who runs the kitchen; the remarkable doctor at the head of the institution.\n\nEpic, enthralling, and meticulously crafted, Night Watch is a stunning chronicle of surviving war and its aftermath.", readers: 1023, cover: "b112", genre: .essays, rating: 4.7, year: "", length: "", discussion: Discussion(id: UUID(), posts: []), reviews: [:], price: 7.99),

                                   Book(id: UUID(), title: "On Earth We're Briefly Gorgeous", author: YuvalNoahHarrari, synopsis: "On Earth We’re Briefly Gorgeous is a letter from a son to a mother who cannot read. Written when the speaker, Little Dog, is in his late twenties, the letter unearths a family’s history that began before he was born — a history whose epicenter is rooted in Vietnam — and serves as a doorway into parts of his life his mother has never known, all of it leading to an unforgettable revelation. At once a witness to the fraught yet undeniable love between a single mother and her son, it is also a brutally honest exploration of race, class, and masculinity. Asking questions central to our American moment, immersed as we are in addiction, violence, and trauma, but undergirded by compassion and tenderness, On Earth We’re Briefly Gorgeous is as much about the power of telling one’s own story as it is about the obliterating silence of not being heard.\n\nWith stunning urgency and grace, Ocean Vuong writes of people caught between disparate worlds, and asks how we heal and rescue one another without forsaking who we are. The question of how to survive, and how to make of it a kind of joy, powers the most important debut novel of many years.", readers: 1023, cover: "b107", genre: .essays, rating: 4.7, year: "", length: "", discussion: Discussion(id: UUID(), posts: []), reviews: [:], price: 7.99),

Her suicidal mother is living in her bed.\n\nGifty is determined to discover the scientific basis for the suffering she sees all around her. But even as she turns to the hard sciences to unlock the mystery of her family's loss, she finds herself hungering for her childhood faith and grappling with the evangelical church in which she was raised, whose promise of salvation remains as tantalizing as it is elusive.", readers: 1023, cover: "b109", genre: .essays, rating: 4.7, year: "", length: "", discussion: Discussion(id: UUID(), posts: []), reviews: [:], price: 7.99),

There is also the fact she was addressing some pretty juicy parts to her life, and people do love to gossip, especially when it comes to public figures.\n\nI had first known of Emily not because of her modeling, but because of the articles she wrote about being in the modeling industry. I remember reading a piece about how a photographer had her posing nude and then selling her image awhile back, which reappears in this essay collection.

My Body is a series of essays—it’s not a novel, not a memoir. These are a comprehensive collection of essays that are tied around Emily’s experiences as a model, one who specifically started when she was a teenager and then found herself blowing up after appearing in the music video for “Blurred Lines”; a music video in which she was heavily sexualized, especially by the singer himself.\n\n That is one of the most common threads behind these essays: the notion that young women are being sexualized and exploited in the modeling industry", upvotes: 1346, comments: sampleComments, book: MyBody)]

Her writing isn't terrible (considering what I was expecting), but I struggle to imagine it holding weight if she were to turn her observation outward. The woman is overly fixated on public perception, and this seems more like an attempt to be rebranded as Joan Didion than it does a valiant effort to direct a wider discussion on the harms of objectifying/commodifying women. In spite of her effort to absolve herself of accountability, she does nothing to acknowledge her place in perpetuating the very structure she claims to be fighting against. \n\n It's strange that she frequently victimizes herself for coming from a financially precarious upbringing, but her descriptions of a southern Californian upbringing (which involved frequent international travel and an expensive education) suggest otherwise. She desperately wants to be seen as an underdog, but comes off incredibly self absorbed and out of touch. \n\n And the writing- It seems like a sloppy imitation of \"Good\" writing, but it was overly self congratulatory and lacks self awareness. She is incapable of forming a cohesive observation of anything beyond her own self delusion. An attempt was made, but I definitely would not recommend this book to anyone looking for something of substance.", likes: 40, book: MyBody, spoiler: false),
